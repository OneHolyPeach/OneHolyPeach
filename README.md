**`Curiosity Fueled`** **`Professional Scientist | Amateur Programmer`**

I am a 23 year old who loves science, technology, and is fascinated by the complex. I graduated earlier this year from **Bellarmine University** with a Major in *Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,* and a *Minor in Chemistry*. I am currently working as a Clinical Scientist doing infectious disease testing for healthcare providers. Everyday I pursue my passion for computers and programming by completing personal projects and projects with friends.  

I started learning to program around 7 years ago, when I realized it was the logical next step on my journey with computers. During those first years I learned bits and pieces, enough to have fun. But around 2 years ago I started to take programming more seriously and I aim to become a competent programmer. As of right now, I feel like I have a grasp on a lot of the major concepts of programming and I enjoy seeing everyday how my understanding of this world expands more and more.  

### 🧑‍💻 Currently Working On:  
- Nothing, getting used to work and figuring life out!

#### 🗄️ On Hold:  
- A Discord Bot using Python ([cakebot](https://github.com/holypeachy/cakebot))
- Learning the Godot Engine. After the Unity debacle, the engine left a bad taste in my mouth. I might go back to Unity one day.

**🗃️ On my GitHub** you will find C# .NET and Unity personal projects. I am also using python for a discord bot I'm working on with a friend but I am not yet too comfortable with it.

**🎩 I am part** of a small game dev team I formed with some friends from Uni: <a href="https://github.com/TeaPot-TopHats"><strong>TeaPot TopHats</strong></a>
