**`Curiosity Fueled`** **`Professional Scientist | Hobbyist Programmer | Amateur Musician`**

I am a 22 year old who loves science, technology, and is fascinated by the complex. I am currently finishing my studies at **Bellarmine University** in *Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,* with a *Minor in Chemistry*. I am starting my professional career as a Biochemist and pursuing my passion for computers and programming.  
I started learning to program around 6 years ago, when I realized it was the logical next step in my journey with computers. In that time I learned bits and pieces, enough to have fun. But around a year ago I started to take programming more seriously and I aim to become a competent programmer.

🗃️ In my GitHub you will find simple and beginner friendly projects, but as time passes they will increase in number and complexity!

🎩 I am also part of a small game dev team I formed with some friends from Uni: <a href="https://github.com/TeaPot-TopHats"><strong>TeaPot TopHats</strong></a>
