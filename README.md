**`Curiosity Fueled`** **`Professional Scientist | Amateur Programmer`**

I am a 23 year old who loves science, technology, and is fascinated by the complex. I recently graduated from **Bellarmine University** with a Major in *Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,* and a *Minor in Chemistry*. I will soon be starting my professional career as a Biochemist and everyday I pursue my passion for computers and programming by completing personal projects and projects with friends.  

I started learning to program around 7 years ago, when I realized it was the logical next step on my journey with computers. During those first years I learned bits and pieces, enough to have fun. But around 2 years ago I started to take programming more seriously and I aim to become a competent programmer. As of right now, I feel like I have a grasp on a lot of the major concepts of programming and I enjoy seeing everyday how my understanding of this world expands more and more.
