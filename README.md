- 👋 Hi, I’m @HolyPeachy! Most friends online call me Peach.
- 👀 I am interested in a lot of things. Piano and music, competitive video games (CS:GO), Biochemistry (I'm a BMB Major with a Chemistry Minor), and programming!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Unity. But I've used C++ and Python in the past when I was getting start in programming! I would like to return to C++ in the future.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything right now. I have a wonderful little dev team that we formed during University to do game jams.
